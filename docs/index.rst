Welcome to stc_unicef_cpi's documentation!
==========================================

**stc_unicef_cpi** is a Python library for the open source data science for international development community
that estimates high-resolution, multi-dimensional child poverty using
`DHS`_ (and soon `MICS`_!) geocoded survey data.

The package was initially developed during `DSSGxUK`_ 22, in collaboration with Save the Children and UNICEF.


Check out the :doc:`getting-started` section for further information about how to begin, including :ref:`installation` of the package.
