Welcome to stc_unicef_cpi's documentation!
==========================================

**stc_unicef_cpi** is a Python library for the open source data science for international development community
that estimates high-resolution, multi-dimensional child poverty using
`DHS`_ (and soon `MICS`_!) geocoded survey data.

The package was initially developed during `DSSGxUK`_ 22, in collaboration with Save the Children and UNICEF.


Check out the :doc:`getting-started` section for further information about how to begin, including :ref:`installation` of the package.

Raw data used is explained in :doc:`data`, methodology in :doc:`methodology` (with sections on e.g. :ref:`data_prep` etc.), and some
initial results are displayed in :doc:`results`.

Information for contributors is available in :doc:`devinfo`.
