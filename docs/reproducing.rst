===============

.. _reproducing data:

Reproducing data
----------------

Pass



.. _reproducing models:

Reproducing models
----------------

To train models with the same pipeline as we used, for the same countries, simply run ``bash train_countries.sh``.




.. _reproducing predictions:

Reproducing predictions
-----------------------

To use these models to make all the predictions, then just run ``bash predict_countries.sh``.





Additional steps
-----------------

Prediction intervals are not automatically generated as part of the pipeline. They will be incorporated soon, but in the meantime you
may follow steps as in ``./notebooks/prediction_intervals.ipynb``.
